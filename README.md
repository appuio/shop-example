This repository is an umbrella repository that contains the entire example project built for the [APPUiO Microservices Example](http://docs.appuio.ch/en/latest/#microservices-example).

The application can be started up locally using the included `docker-compose.yml`. Docker Compose as well as all tools necessary for building and running the application are included in the provided `Vagrantfile`.


Starting up the application
--------------------------

To start the application with **Vagrant**, you will first need to make sure you have installed an appropriate version (we developed with Vagrant 1.9.3).
